/**
 * ## Mysticism Effect Manager
 *
 * This manager is responsible for applying and coordinating various in-game effects
 * that are directly tied to a player's mysticism level.
 * It primarily handles:
 * - Updating the visual [MysticismBar] based on current mysticism levels.
 * - Managing player flight status (enabling if positive mysticism, disabling if zero/negative).
 *
 * The BossBar's visibility is now solely determined by whether a player has
 * any mysticism (level > 0) or no mysticism (level <= 0).
 *
 * @property plugin The main [Plugin] instance, used for logging.
 * @property flightManager The [FlightManager] instance, used to control player flight abilities.
 * @property mysticismBar The [MysticismBar] instance, used to display, hide, and update the BossBar.
 * @property messageService The [MessageService] instance, used to send messages to players.
 * @property pluginConfig The [PluginConfig] instance, providing access to all configurable values.
