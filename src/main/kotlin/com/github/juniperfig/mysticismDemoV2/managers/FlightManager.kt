/**
 * ## Flight Manager
 *
 * This manager controls player flight ability based on their mysticism levels.
 * It implements the [FlightController] interface to provide a programmatic way to enable/disable flight,
 * and it also acts as a [Listener] to react to players attempting to toggle flight.
 *
 * Key responsibilities include:
 * - Granting or revoking the `player.allowFlight` property.
 * - Starting and stopping the mysticism drain for flight via [MysticismDrainService].
 * - Sending messages to players regarding their flight status or lack of mysticism.
 * - Preventing flight if mysticism is too low or the ability is not granted.
 *
 * @property plugin The main [Plugin] instance, used for logging.
 * @property mysticismTracker The [MysticismTracker] instance, used to check player mysticism levels.
 * @property mysticismDrainService The [MysticismDrainService] instance, used to manage the continuous mysticism drain.
 * @property messageService The [MessageService] instance, used to send various messages to players.
 * @property pluginConfig The [PluginConfig] instance, providing access to all configurable values.
 *

     * Programmatically sets whether a player has the *ability* to fly (i.e., sets `player.allowFlight`).

     * This method primarily controls the *permission* to fly. It does not directly
     * start or stop the actual mysticism drain; that is handled by the `onPlayerToggleFlight`
     * event handler when the player actively chooses to fly.
     *
     * When enabling flight, it simply grants the ability.
     * When disabling flight, it forces the player to land and removes the flight drain source.
     * The BossBar visibility is managed automatically by [MysticismEffectManager] based on mysticism level.
     *
     * @param player The [Player] whose flight ability is to be changed.
     * @param enabled A [Boolean] flag: `true` to allow flight, `false` to disallow.
